# What is a USN ?

A USN (Ubuntu Security Notice) is the way for Canonical to public catalog and display security
vulneratibility for Ubuntu packages. Usually, a USN is composed by one or more
[CVEs](what_is_a_cve.md) and it also contains update instructions to fix the issue, if a fix is
already available.

Similar to a CVE, a USN also follows a name pattern like this one [USN-5963-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5963-1)
