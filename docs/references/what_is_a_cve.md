# What is a CVE

A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a way to catalog and track public security
vulnerabilities for a given software. Every CVE is identified through a unique identifier,
for example [CVE-2023-0465](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0465).

CVEs are maintained by the [MITRE Corporarion](https://cve.mitre.org/) and the goal of the project
is to provide naming conventions for the public known security issues while also maintaining a
centralized repository for all of the security issues. This makes it easier for a organization to
submit a new security flaw thought the CVE convention while also analyzing any other existing CVEs
in the database.
